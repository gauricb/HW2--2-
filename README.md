# Neural Network: Multi-layer perceptron built from scratch

I built a multilayer perceptron from scratch with forward and backward propagation, gradient descent, and activation functions

**Concepts I learned and used:**

- Neural Network Architecture
- Feedforward Process
- Activation Functions
- Weights and Biases
- Backpropagation
- Loss Functions
- Gradient Descent
- Learning Rate
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Matrix Operations and Linear Algebra
